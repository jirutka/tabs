No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be faded to telling only lies

[refren]
         C D                   G
But my dre-ams they aren't as empty
       C         D        E
As my conscience seems to be
        Bm            C
i have hours, only lonely
            D                      A
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what its like
To feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you!
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain woe
Can show through

[refren]

No one knows what its like
To be mistreated, to be defeated
Behind blue eyes
No one know how to say
That they're sorry and don't worry
I'm not telling lies

[refren]

No one knows what its like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

[end]

In the clouds
All the graves
I'll stay if you
Go away
Concrete
Tall as the sky
Movement passi'n me by
When you blush
What a rush
Reminisce
Cold crush
Next door ear to the wall
All the tension on me for the call
I wish I wish
I wish it was all that easy
I wish I wish
I wish it was all that easy
