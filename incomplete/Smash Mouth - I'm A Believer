[Verse]
    G                 D              G
    I thought love was only true in fairytales
    G                 D                G
    Meant for someone else but not for me
    C               G       C                  G
    Love was out to get me, that's the way it seemed
    C              G               D
    Dissappointment haunted all my dreams

[Chorus]
    Then I saw her face
    C         G        C
    Now I'm a believer.
    C     G          C
    Not a trace
    C               G     C
    Of doubt in my mind.
    C      G            C
    I'm in love
    (ooooooaaaahhh)
    C         G                 F
    I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her
         D
    if I tried

[Verse]
    G                  D              G
    I thought love was more or less a given thing
    G                   D           G
    The more I gave the less I got, Oh Yeah
    C                G
    What's the use of trying
    C              G
    All you get is pain
    C            G               D
    When I wanted sunshine I got rain

[Chorus]
                  G      C
    Then I saw her face
    C          G        C
    Now I'm a believer.
    C     G       C
    Not a trace
    C             G        C
    Of doubt in my mind.
    C      G         C
    I'm in love
    (ooooooaaaahhh)
    C      G                   F
    I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her
         D
    if I tried
    C                           G
    What's the use in tyring
    C                     G
    All you get is pain
    C             G              D
    When I wanted Sunshine I got rain!

[Chorus]
                   G      C
    Then I saw her face
    C         G         C
    Now I'm a believer.
    C      G     C
    Not a trace
    C              G      C
    Of doubt in my mind.
    C        G            C
    I'm in love
    (ooooooaaaahhh)
    C      G                   F
    I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her
        D
    if I tried

    N.C.
    Then I saw her face,
    Now I'm a believer.
    Not a trace
    Of doubt in my mind.
    I'm a believer, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhaah....
    IÂ´m a Believer (x2)
