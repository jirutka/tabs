[verse]     E             A7
    Here we go, off the rails
               E                 Em        E
    Don't you know it's time to raise our sails?
     A7           Am             E/G# Em/G E2/F# B7
    It's freedom like you never knew
                E          A7
    Don't need bags or a pass,
             E                  C#
    Say the word, I'll be there in a flash
     F#m7             B             E E/B-G# E
    You could say my hat is off to you

    (A A# B A# B D)       A                     A/B      
              Oh, we can zoom all the way to the moon,
             G#m          C#7
    From this great wide wacky world,
                  F#m7               Am/D   B C#m Ddim B
    Jump with me, grab coins with me, oh yeah!

[chorus]         Em7/A          D
    It's time to jump up in the air

    Jump up, don't be scared
         Em7/A             D               Bdim
    Just jump up and your cares will soar away, 
    E           Em7/A                 D
    And if the dark clouds start to swirl,
           Gmaj7              E9     E
    Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause
    Em7/A        D D6    G D/F# 
      You are my 1-Up girl

    G/F        E  Em7/A             D
       So let us all jump up super high
    Gmaj7           E
    High up in the sky
           Em7/A        D         Bdim
    There's no power-up like dancing,
    E               Em7/A          D
    You know that you're my Super Star
           Gmaj7             E9   E 
    No one else can take me this far
        Em7/A          D
    I'm flipping the switch,
         Bm        E
    Get ready for this, so

    You know that any captain needs a crew


    (A A# B A# B D)       A                         A/B  
             Take it in stride as you move, side to side,
               G#m          C#7
    They're just different points of view
                  F#m7               Am/D  B C#m Ddim B
    Jump with me, grab coins with me, Oh yeah!

    Jump without a care
      Em7/A             D               Bdim
    Jump up 'cause you know that I'll be there
         E      Em7/A                 D
    And if you find you're short on joy,
           Gmaj7              E9     E
    Don't fret, just don't forget that
    Em7/A          D D6   G D/F# 
    I'm still your 1-Up Boy

    G/F  E       Em7/A             D
    So go on, straighten out your cap
             Gmaj7           E
    Let your toes begin to tap, 
          Em7/A        D       Bdim
    This rhythm is a power 'shroom
           E      Em7/A           D
    Don't forget you're the Super Star
           Gmaj7             E9   E 
    No one else can make it this far
          Em7/A               D
    Put a comb through that stache,
         Bm            E
