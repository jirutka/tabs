[all]
    Dmi                 Ami        Dmi
    Home is behind, the world's ahead,
                       Ami         Dmi
    and there are many paths to tread
    Dmi                   Bb      Dmi  
    Through shadow to the edge of night
                        Ami    Dmi 
    until the stars are all alight
    Dmi                 Bb     Dmi   
    Mist and shadow, cloud and shade.
                      Ami                Dmi
    All shall fade.  All..  shall.....   fade...
