[intro] Emi

[verse]   Emi              Dmi
    Still round the corner there may wait
    A new road or a secret gate,

        Emi            Gmi
    And though we pass them by today,
        Emi            Dmi
    Tomorrow we may come this way
    And take the hidden paths that run
    Toward the Moon or to the Sun.

[verse]
    Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe,
    Let them go! Let them go!

    Sand and stone and pool and dell.
    Fare you well! Fare you well!

[solo]

[verse]
    Home is behind, the world ahead,
    And there are many paths to tread

    Through shadows to the edge of night,
    Until the stars are all alight.
    Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,
    Away shall fade! Away shall fade!

[verse]
    Then world behind and home ahead,
    WeÂ´ll wander back to home and bed.

    Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,
    And to bed! And then to bed!
