C                 Ami
1. I've heard there was a secret chord
C                    Ami
That David played, and it pleased the Lord.
F                G               C      G
But you don't really care for music, do you? 
C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
Ami             F
The minor fall, the major lift
G               E7          Ami
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

F           Ami
R: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
        F           C    G7   C
   Hallelujah, Hallelu-uuuu-ujah

2. Your faith was strong but you needed proof
   You saw her bathing on the roof  
   Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
   She tied you
   To a kitchen chair
   She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
   And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
R:

3. You say I took the name in vain
   I don't even know the name
   But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
   There's a blaze of light
   In every word
   It doesn't matter which you heard
   The holy or the broken Hallelujah
R:

4. I did my best, it wasn't much
   I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
   I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
   And even though
   It all went wrong
   I'll stand before the Lord of Song
   With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
