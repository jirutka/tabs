[Verse]         G     C        G   C       F     C   G       C
    When you're weary. Feeling small. When tears are in your eyes
           G            C
    I will dry them all.
    G   D   Em    D                 G       G7
    I'm on your side ohhhh when times get rough.
                    C      A   D
    And friends just can't be found.
    G7     C             G        E7  C        B7        Em
    Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down.

[Verse]
    When you're down and out.  When you're on the streets yeh.
    When evening falls so hard. I will comfort you.
    I'll take your part ohhhh  when darkness comes.
    And pain is all around.
    Like a  bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down.
    Like a  bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down.
     
[Verse]
    Sail on silver girl. Sail on by.
    Your time has come to shine.
    All your dreams are on their way.
    See how they shine ohhhhh and if you need a friend.
    I'm sailing right behind.
    Like a  bridge over troubled water, I will ease your mind.
    Like a  bridge over troubled water, I will ease your mind.
