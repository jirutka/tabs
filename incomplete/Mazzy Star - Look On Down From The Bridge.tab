[Intro]
C  G  F  C  x2


C                     G     
Look on down from the bridge
             F               C 
There's still fountains down there
                      G  
Look on down from the bridge 
          F           C      Am
It's still raining up here
                   F                  Am
Everybody seems so far away from me 
               F                  C 
Everybody just want to be free


                   G   
Look away from the sky 
       F                              C
It's no different when you're leaving home
                          G          
I can't be the same thing to you now 
      F          C         Am
I'm just gone, just gone
            F              Dm 
How could I say goodbye?  
            F          C     G     F    C      
How could I say goodbye? Goodbye  


[Break]
C    G    F   C  x2


Am                          F                Am
   Maybe I'll just place my hands over you
                   F           C
And close my eyes real tight
                     G     
There's a light in your eyes
        F              C
And you know, yeah you know
                      G
Look on down from the bridge 
         F         C        
I'm still waiting for you


[Outro]
Am  F  Dm  F  
C   G  F   C  x2
