From Tim's new arena tour. Of course it doesn't compare to the man himself and his 
gigantic orchestra, but it's something to play along with if you enjoy the song and/or want 
to spread the message about rationalism. Enjoy! And buy the album!


[Verse 1]
G                                 G
Somewhere in your wardrobe I'd be willing to bet
         F                            C
there's a t-shirt probly bearing the silhouette of Che Guevara

(not sure on this little funky bit as I can't find a way to make it fit in with the 
song, just sticking to a pause after the C, but here's what I think it is)
E-----------------------------|
B-----------------------------|

D---3p1p0---3p1p0----3--5-----|
E---------3-------3-----------|
(anyway, on with the show)

       G
He was revolutionary, yeah, he wore a cool hat
       F                                           C
but behind the design I think you might find it's not quite as simple as that

(funky bit)
Bb5                           A5                             G
Che was a bit of a homophobe, Che was a bit of a homophooooobe    x2


[Chorus]
            G         Bm                 C
This is my song in defence of the fence
                       D
A little sing along, a tribute to ambivalence
    D#                                Bb
The more you know the harder you will find it
                F                                      D#
To make up your mind it doesn't really matter if you find
                                D#
You can't see which grass is greener
                 Bb                          F
Chances are it's neither and either way it's easier
                D#                F               G
To see the difference when you're sitting on the fence


[Verse 2]
G
Somewhere in your house I'd be willing to bet
          F                               C
there's a picture of that grinning hippy from Tibet - the Dalai Llama

(funky town)
        G
He's a lovely, funny fella, he does good stuff galore
    F                                          C
but let's not forget that back in Tibet those funky monks used to dick the poor yeah

(funktaculous)
         Bb                                             A              
                   G
And the [Buddhist slime?] about future lives is the perfect way to stop the powerless 
rising up
        Bb                                      A                      
                 G
And he tells the poor they will live again, cos he's rich now so it's easy for him to say


[Chrous]
             G           Bm                C
I'm taking a stand in defence of the fence
                C                       D
I got a little band playing anthems to ambivalence
     D#                                 Bb
We divide the world into terrorists and heroes
                     F                             D#
Into normal folk and weirdos, into good people and paedos
                          D#                                Bb
Into things that give you cancer and the things that cu-ure cancer
                                F
And the things that don't cause cancer, but there's a chance they will cause cancer in 
the future
      D#                               Bb
We divide the world to stop us feeling frightened
                     F                            D#
Into wrong and into right and into black and into white and
                  D#                           Bb
into real men and fairies, into status quo and scary
                       F                        D#       F    
   G
yeah we want the world binary, binary, but it's not that simple.

ROCK! (no idea how this would work on an acoustic, but if you want you can hit an F for 
a few bars while shaking your head around like a maniac)

Into atheists and fundies, into tee-tot'lers and junkies
                  D#                          Bb
Into chemical and natural, into fictional and factual
                      F
Into science and supernatural, but it's actually naturally not that white and black 
you'll be
  D#                             Bb
Dividing us into terrorists and heroes
