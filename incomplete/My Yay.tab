D                F#mi
And now, the end is near,
F#mi7         H7
And so I face the final curtain,
Emi             Emi7
My friend. I'll say it clear,
A7                D
I'll stay my case of which I'm certain.
D                 D7
I've lived a live that's full.
G                Gmi
I travelled each and every highway,
D                   A7               Emi D
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again, too few to mention.
I did what I had to do,
And saw it thru without exemption.
I planned each chattered course,
Each careful step along the byway,
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

D                     D7
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
G
When I bit off more than I could chew,
Emi7                  A7
But thru it all, when there was doubt,
F#mi7             Hmi
I ate it up, and spit it out.
Emi7            A7
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
D
And did it my way.
