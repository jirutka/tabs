[Verse]
  Dm C Gm     F                Dm                    C
Indo - china, Capa jumps Jeep, two feet creep up the road
Gm        F         Dm             C
To photo, to record meat lumps and war,
Gm              F               C Gm Dm
They advance as does his chance oh 
Cm                 Dm    C
 very yellow white flash.
Gm          F                       Dm                      C
  A violent wrench grips mass, rips light, tears limbs like rags,
Gm                F
Burst so high finally Capa lands, 
Dm               C    Gm              F
Mine is a watery pit. Painless with immense distance
     Cm                               Gm
From medic from colleague, friend, enemy,
         Dm                  Cm              Gm F Cm Gm Dm C Gm F
foe, him five yards from his leg, From you Taro.
Cm           Gm          Dm                 C            Dm C Gm F
Do not spray into eyes – I have sprayed you into my eyes.


[verse 2]
  Dm C Gm  F                 Dm                          C            
3:10   pm, Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes
    Gm                F              Dm                         C
All colours and cares glaze to grey, shrivelled and stricken to dots,
Gm                        F               C Gm Dm
Left hand grasps what the body grasps not oh 
Cm                    Dm   C
   le photographe est mort.
Gm  F     Dm                 C     Gm                     F
 3.1415, alive no longer my amour, faded for home May of '54
      Dm                C    Gm               F
Doors open like arms my love, Painless with a great closeness
   Cm                 Gm
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing,
    Dm             Cm                  Gm F Cm Gm Dm C Gm F
re-united with his leg and with you, Taro.

Cm           Gm          Dm                 C            Dm C Gm F
Do not spray into eyes – I have sprayed you into my eyes.
