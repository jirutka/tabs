[VERSE 1]
Dm         C/D
This is me for forever 
Bb/D            Dm
One  of the lost  ones 
    Dm            C/E
The one without a name
           Gm              F/C   C 
Without an honest heart as com - pass
Dm         C/D
This is me for forever 
Bb/D          Dm
One without a name 
      Gm                Dm
These lines, the last endeavor
   Gm               F/C C 
to find the missing lifeline


[CHORUS 1]
Dm
    Oh how I wish for soothing rain 
F/C              C
    All I wish is to dream again 
Dm
    My loving heart, lost in the dark 
F                    C
    For hope I'd give my everything 


[VERSE 2]
Dm           C/D
  My flower, withered between 
      Bb/D       Dm
  the pages 2 and   3 
      Dm          C/E
  The once and forever bloom
  Gm           F/C C
  gone with my sins
  Fm
  Walk the dark path
  Eb/F
  Sleep with angels 
  Db/F             Fm
  Call the past for  help 
  Bbm                Fm
  Touch me with your love 
        Bbm           Eb
  And reveal to me my true name


[CHORUS 2]
Dm
    Oh how I wish for soothing rain 
F/C              C
    All I wish is to dream again 
Dm
    My loving heart, lost in the dark 
F                    C
    For hope I'd give my everything 
Dm
    Oh how I wish for soothing rain 
F/C              C
    Oh how I wish to dream again
