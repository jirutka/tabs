[Intro]

F           Dm G     Am    Am/B     Am/C   Am/D Am
F           Dm G     Am       G   


[Verse 1]
Am Em
Dm G

Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me.
The lengths that I will go to,
The distance in your eyes,
Oh no, I've said too much,
I set it up.

[Chorus]
Am Em
Dm G

That's me in the corner,
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion.
Trying to keep up with you.
And I don't know if I can do it.
Oh no, I've said too much,
I haven't said enough.

[Bridge]

  G                        F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
  Dm             G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm   G   Am     G
I  think I thought I saw  you try.

[Verse 2]

Every Whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions,
Trying to keep an eye of you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much,
I set it up.

[Verse 3]

Consider this, consider this,
The hint of a century,
Consider this: the slip
That brought me to my knees failed.
What if all these fantasies
Come    flailing around?
Now I've said too much.

[Bridge]
