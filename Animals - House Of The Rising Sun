[Verse 1] 

      Am   C        D          F
There is a house in New Orleans,
      Am       C      E7
They call the "Rising Sun",
     Am       C       D           F
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
    Am     E         Am    C  D  F  Am  E7 Am  
And God, I know, I'm one.

      Am   C        D          F
My mother was a tailor,
      Am       C      E7
She sewed my new blue jeans,
     Am       C       D           F
My father was a gambling man,
    Am     E         Am    C  D  F  Am  E7 Am  
Down in New Orleans.

      Am   C        D          F
Now the only thing a gambler needs,
      Am       C      E7
Is a suitcase and a trunk,
     Am       C       D           F
And the only time, he's satisfied, is when
    Am     E         Am    C  D  F  Am  E7 Am  
He's on a drunk

[Verse 2]

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done -
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of Rising Sun

Well, I've  got one foot on the platform,
The other's on the train,
I'm going back to New Orleans,
to wear that ball and chain.

      Am   C        D          F
Well, there is a house in new Orleans
      Am       C      E7
They call the "Rising Sun",
     Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
    Am     E         Am
And God, I know, I'm one.
[alternative]
Beneath that "Rising Sun".
