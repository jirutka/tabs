capo 4

[Verse]
    Ami                 Emi   Ami
    Home is behind, the world ahead,
        Ami            Emi      Ami
    And there are many paths to tread

            Ami            G       Ami
    Through shadows to the edge of night,
      Ami           Emi      Ami
    Until the stars are all alight.
    Mist and shadow, clo-o-oud and shade,
    All shall fade! All shall fade!
