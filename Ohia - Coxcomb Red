[Verse]
A#m                G#
  And I wanted that heat so bad
                     D#m          A#m
    i could taste the fire on your breath 
A#m                   G#
  And I wanted in your storm so bad 
                     D#m               A#m
    i could taste the lightning on your breath 
A#m            G#                   D#m
  I watched you hold the son in your arms
                    A#m
    while he bled to death 
A#m         G#           F#    A#m
  He grew so pale next to you 
A#m              G#          F#    A#m    
  The world is so pale next to you 

[Chorus]
A#m            G#                        F#       A#m
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

[Verse]
A#m                       G#       F#    A#m
  You said every road is a good road 
              A#m                G#        F#  A#m
  Between the next road and your last road
A#m                 G#       F#    A#m
  Every love is your best love
  And every love is your last love
  And every kiss is a goodbye
  Every kiss is a goodbye

A#m            G#                   D#m

    while he bled to death 
A#m         G#           F#    A#m
  He grew so pale next to you 
A#m              G#           F#    A#m
  The world is so pale next to you 

[Chorus]
A#m            G#                        F#       A#m
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
