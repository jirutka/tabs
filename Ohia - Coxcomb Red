Am  G  Dm  Am

[Verse]
Am                G
  And I wanted that heat so bad
                     Dm          Am
    i could taste the fire on your breath 
Am                   G
  And I wanted in your storm so bad 
                     Dm               Am
    i could taste the lightning on your breath 
Am            G                   Dm
  I watched you hold the son in your arms
                    Am
    while he bled to death 
Am         G           F    Am
  He grew so pale next to you 
Am              G          F    Am    
  The world is so pale next to you 

[Chorus]
Am            G                        F       Am
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

Am  G  Dm  Am

[Verse]
Am                       G       F    Am
  You said every road is a good road 
              Am                G        F  Am
  Between the next road and your last road
Am                 G       F    Am
  Every love is your best love
  And every love is your last love
  And every kiss is a goodbye
  Every kiss is a goodbye

Am            G                   Dm
  I watched you hold the son in your arms
                    Am
    while he bled to death 
Am         G           F    Am
  He grew so pale next to you 
Am              G           F    Am
  The world is so pale next to you 

[Chorus]
Am            G                        F       Am
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
  Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

Am  G  Dm  Am
Am  G  Dm  Am
